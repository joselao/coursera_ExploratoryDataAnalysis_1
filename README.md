# Coursera week 1 of "Exploratory Data Analysis"

### Instructions
There are 4 R scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) that will generate 4 plots (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png).

All the "plotX.R" R scripts will call the function ReadData(), this function is defined inside the script: "Course_project_1_ReadData.R" that is in charge of reading the data from "household_power_consumption.txt" and return a TABLE needed for "plotX.R" R scripts.

At the end you only wil need to execute any of "plotX.R" R scripts

### Coursera assigment instructions
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/),
a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the
“Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over
a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):

1_Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2_Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3_Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4_Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5_Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6_Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7_Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8_Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9_Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
